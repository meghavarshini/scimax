#+TITLE: Solutions directory

You should create assignment solutions in this directory. Each solution will be its own directory and git-repo. The remote will be something like {{host}}:solution/[a-z].*. The solution label must start with a lower-case letter and should be the solution to the assignment with the same label.

You can create solutions with:
elisp:tq-create-solution This will prompt you for a label from the known assignments, copying and cloning the solution in this directory.

You can grant access to the solutions to the students with this command:
elisp:tq-release-solution

You can remove access to the solutions by the students with this command:
elisp:tq-close-solution 

In the syllabus, you can create a link to the "label" solution like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[[solution:label]]
#+END_EXAMPLE
